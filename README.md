<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Cisco certifications have been an industry standard for several decades in network technologies and have a great value to those that hold them. Cisco has a new line of certifcations called the DevNet, in which the test taker must show proficient skills using network automation tools, software programming, and operations deployments. While there is a great book that has been officially released as the guide to the exam, sandbox labs on developer.cisco.com. Having achieved these certifications and knowing that there aren't many other courses available I wanted to show students one large project that employ's most of what is on the test to give near real life experience. However, this project does not provide 100% of what is covered on the exam and should be considered complimentary.

Here's what you'll learn:
* Basics and some special tips for running the linux/GNU OS and developing with python on the platform.
* How to take a basic software project requirements document and create several scripts and a webapp to deploy.
* How to create a github account, deploy cloud servers, and automate deploying the web app through Ansible.
* How to use API's and SDK's to manage Cisco products with a focus on the Meraki product line.
* How to design a website using the MVC design pattern and python Flask; including debuging.
* How to troubleshoot the various tools, syntax, and even practice understanding how html response codes work.

As was stated earlier this course does not go over every Cisco product covered in the exam! You will still need to study the official guide and free developer sandboxes to succeed. However, I believe that we will cover that vast majority of the coding practice that will be needed.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This code is part of a Udemy Course. Feel free to read and use for studying for the Cisco DevNet. Otherwise head over here: https://Udemy.com/course to check out the full course. 

### Prerequisites

*You will need to understand how to install and use linux at a basic level.
*Advanced python is not covered in this course nor is it currently required in the DevNet Associates Exam only basic syntax will be needed.
*You will still need a full study guide to take the exam this course only covers about 60% of the material through a real live project. 

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get the always on Meraki Sandbox key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. When testing API calls you can simulate the experience with this Key.
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/EdNetTitan/Unofficial_DevNet_CourseWork.git
   ```
3. Create a new virtual environment, start it, install packages.
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv your_virt_name
   source your_virt_name/bin/activate
   cd Unofficial_DevNetCourseWork
   pip install -r requirements.txt 
   ```
4. open the app startup script, enter your Meraki api key, run the app startup script
   ```sh
   ./start_app.sh
   ```
